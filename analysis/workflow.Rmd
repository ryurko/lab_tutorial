# Creating a new analysis file

You can create a new analysis .Rmd file manually or using the `workflowr` package:

```{r init-ex, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_open("analysis/ex-analysis.Rmd")
```

Once you have made your file and edits, the __workflow__ follows the same steps each time:

#. build / knit the R Markdown files, `wflow_build()`,
#. commit / publish updates, `wflow_publish()`,
#. push updates to GitHub/GitLab, `wflow_git_push()`.

If you are collaborating on the project then you should obviously follow the Git tenet:
commit, pull, push. You can pull updates from collaborators via `wflow_git_pull()`.

# Customizing the website

In order to access the new analysis HTML file on the site, you need a link to it
somehow. You can just use a [link on a page in markdown](ex-analysis.html). Or you 
can modify the `_site.yml` directly to add a new tab.

You can change the theme with `_site.yml`, or take direct control [using a custom CSS file](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-02-customization.html) to modify
the appearance of your site as you wish.

Following any updates to `_site.yml`, or cosmetic changes that affect all HTML 
files you will need to use the `republish = TRUE` argument when publishing the
updated site:

```{r wflow-republish, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_publish("analysis/_site.yml", "Change the theme and nav bar", 
              republish = TRUE)
```


# General advice

My recommendation is to pick the stylistic settings and type of content you want
to enable easy navigation to early. __Any change you make to style or navigation
affects the HTML pages for every analysis file.__ Meaning you will have to re-build
all files each time regardless of when that analysis was done before, which could
take considerable time to re-run. 

Also, you cannot directly use R Notebooks in the way of generating chunk output and
easily uploading the resulting HTML. You still need to build the HTML files each time
as in traditional R Markdown knitting. Because of this, I recommend performing time
consuming tasks outside of the `analysis/` folder files. Instead use traditional
scripts in the `code/` folder to pre-process, fit time consuming models, etc. Then
you can use summaries / smaller dataset to display results or figures in the `analysis/`
files. Additionally, you can also display figures by creating another sub-folder (e.g. `assets/`) in the `docs/` (or `public/` for GitLab) folder and referencing figures that way.
