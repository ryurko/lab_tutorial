# What is `workflowr`?

```{r hex, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", out.height = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/hex-workflowr.png")
```

Created and maintained by [John Blischak](https://jdblischak.com/), with co-authors 
[Peter Carbonetto](https://pcarbo.github.io/) and [Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/), the [`workflowr`](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) package provides a wrapper
for publishing a research website using R Markdown and version control. 
The package tagline is "_organized + reproducible + shareable data science in R_".

The only requirements to use `workflowr` are a knowledge of `R` and R Markdown, with
either a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account to
host your site. __No prior knowledge, [or even installation](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-04-how-it-works.html), of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is necessary to get started!__

# First steps...

You can install `workflowr` via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=workflowr):

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("workflowr")
```

To create a project with `workflowr`, first load the package:

```{r library, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(workflowr)
```

__If you have NEVER created a Git repository before__: you first need to initialize
Git with your name and email. This information is how Git tracks your changes, but
this does NOT need to be the same name / email used for your GitHub or GitLab accounts. 
Since `workflowr` relies on [`git2r`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r) (which
is an interface to [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.github.com/) and the reason you 
do NOT need to have Git installed prior to using), you can do this directly in `R` 
with a `workflowr` function:

```{r start-git, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Initialize your Git info (only need to do once per computer)
wflow_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "your@email")
```

Now (within your current directory) you can create a `workflowr` repository:

```{r start-workflowr, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_start("lab_tutorial")
```

```{r start-output, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", out.height = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/wflow_start_output.png")
```

This will change the current working directory to the newly created project 
folder, with the following layout:

```{r directory-fig, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", out.height = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/wflow_directory.png")
```

There are two __required__ subdirectories:

#. `analysis/`: stores the R Markdown files of your analysis, along with `index.Rmd` (for the homepage) and  `_site.yml` (for the configuration settings such as theme),
#. `docs/` (or `public/` for GitLab): stores the HTML files used for generating the site, as well as figures created by code chunks.

Optional directories for organization include: `code/`, `data/`, and `output/`.

# Publishing the website

Initially the `docs/` (or `public/`) folder will be empty, because the starting three `analysis/`
files (`index.Rmd`, `about.Rmd`, `license.Rmd`) were not built / 'knit' yet. Rather than
manually doing this, `workflowr` provides a function to generate the appropriate 
HTML files in the `docs/` folder:

```{r build-demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_build()
```

```{r build-fig, echo = FALSE, out.width= "500px", out.height= "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/wflow_build.png")
```

This builds each HTML file __in separate R sessions__ to avoid conflicts (such as
shared variable names) and __sets the same seed__ from the `_workflowr.yml` settings.
The `wflow_build()` function only builds R Markdown files if their .Rmd files have
been modified more recently than the current HTML files. After running `wflow_build()` you
will see the "website" in the Viewer tab of RStudio.

However, "building" the site is not enough. In order to "publish" the website online,
we need to specify which `analysis/` files to build and "publish" their resulting
HTML files:

```{r publish-demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"),
              "Publish the initial files for lab_tutorial")
```

The first argument is a vector of the `analysis/` files to generate the HTML files
for, followed by the __commit message__ describing the update. The convenience of
using `wflow_publish()` is that it: (1) commits the R Markdown files, (2) builds
their respective HTML files, and (3) commits the HTML files along with any other
website style changes.

In order to view the website for the project, you need to link it to a 
GitHub/GitLab repository. This will then host the HTML files via the Pages 
feature of the respective site. You can create the repository from within `R` 
(following permission prompts):

```{r github-demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_use_github("ryurko", "lab_tutorial")
```

or using `wflow_use_gitlab()` for GitLab. __NOTE: GitHub Pages only works for PUBLIC
accounts, meaning your in-progress research website will always be visible. While
that is admirable, you might be more comfortable using GitLab instead since then you
can host your website with a PRIVATE repository.__ Both are free to use.

Once the above steps are complete, then you need to __push__ your edits to their
respective destinations:

```{r push-demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wflow_git_push()
```

In order for the GitHub pages site to appear you just need to do the following on
your GitHub repository webpage: (1) go to Settings, (2) scroll to GitHub Pages,
(3) choose “master branch docs/ folder” as the Source. Then after a few minutes the
research website should be visible!
